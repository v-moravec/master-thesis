This bachelor's thesis describes the design and implementation of a web application, which helps the user with using cooking recipes.
This is achieved by the management of recipes, ingredients, and sharing of those among the users. Emphasis is placed on the frontend part written in Vue.js.
I will also describe the backend, which was created using the development platform Firebase. I will start by collecting requirements from potential users
and by analyzing existing solutions. After that, I will create the design of the application and describe the structure of the data. Then I will introduce
the technologies used to implement the application. Finally, I will construct a user test and perform it with multiple respondents and describe possible extensions.
The result of this thesis is a web application, which is publicly accessible. It helps anyone who seeks a complete package for cooking recipes.
