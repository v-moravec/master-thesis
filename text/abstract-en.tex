This thesis focuses on the design and development of a collection of reusable components for web applications using the Nuxt framework. The goal is to create a collection of components that simplify the start of development and are easily expandable and modifiable. The work focuses not only on the components themselves but also on their documentation and other tools supporting the entire application lifecycle from design to deployment.

More extensive sections composed of these components are also available. Developers can thus utilize pre-prepared solutions, which they can modify as needed, significantly accelerating the development process.

For designers, a library in Figma has been prepared, allowing them to provide developers with designs that can be replicated in exact accordance with the original. Developers have several ways to install components, either by copying code or using a CLI.
